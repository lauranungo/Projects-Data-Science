# Table-Manipualtion-and-Data-visualization-Python
In this project I exploreD data from Gapminder.org, a website dedicated to providing a fact-based view of the world and how it has changed. That site includes several data visualizations and presentations but also publishes the raw data that we will use in this project to recreate and extend some of their most famous visualizations.
